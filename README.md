A collection of my LeetCode solutions in Python.
I’m solving these problems to practice data structures and algorithms, prepare for coding interviews, and make sure the extra time I have in college doesn’t go to waste.

## **Goals**

- Strengthen core DSA concepts
- Stay consistent with problem-solving practice
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Use my college years to build long-term skills

This repository is mainly for my own practice and consistency, but others are welcome to use it as a reference or learning resource.
