# Leetcode-Solutions
I’m using this repo to post my LeetCode solutions in Python. It’s mainly for practicing data structures and algorithms, getting better at problem-solving, and preparing for future interviews. I’m a college student, so this is part of my extra grind to stay sharp and track my progress along the way.
